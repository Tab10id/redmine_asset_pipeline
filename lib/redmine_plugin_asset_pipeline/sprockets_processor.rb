class RedminePluginAssetPipeline::SprocketsProcessor < Sprockets::DirectiveProcessor
  # This processor subclasses the standard Sprockets::DirectiveProcessor
  # as advised in Sprockets, to add a new directive called
  # "require_redmine_plugins". This directive is relative to the
  # #{Rails.root}/plugins/ directory and accepts wildcards.
  #
  # For convenience, it also replaces "ALL" by a star ("*") before
  # evaluating the globing. Otherwise, "*/" is interpreted as the end of
  # the comment in CSS files, which is obviously problematic.
  #
  #
  # For the record, here's the example custom require provided in sprockets:
  #
  # def process_require_glob_directive
  #  Dir["#{pathname.dirname}/#{glob}"].sort.each do |filename|
  #    require(filename)
  #  end
  # end

  def process_require_redmine_plugins_directive(type, prefix='')
    mask = Rails.root.join(Redmine::Plugin.private_directory_base,  "*/#{type}/#{prefix}_common_part*").expand_path
    Dir.glob(mask).sort.each do |entry|
      context.require_asset(pathname.dirname.join(entry).expand_path)
    end
  end
end
